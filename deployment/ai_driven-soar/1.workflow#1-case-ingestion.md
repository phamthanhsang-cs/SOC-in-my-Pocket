  TheHive 5 Case Ingestion Workflow
</div>

## The Challenge

When I first started automating my project by implementing some SOAR use cases and workflows, it was pretty daunting because I wasn’t sure where to begin.

One of the hardest parts of SOAR is applying creative knowledge to solve challenges when working within a SOC environment.

So far, this is the most essential workflow I’ve created. In the future, as I encounter more challenges in this field, there will definitely be more workflows to come.

## About the Workflow Itself

As you can see in the diagram, this workflow is quite simple and straightforward. When an alert is raised in **Elastic Security** and captured by **ElastAlert2**, it is forwarded to an **n8n Webhook**.

A **lightweight Python script** is used to transform the data and extract the necessary fields required to ingest it as a **TheHive5 alert**.

Alongside automatically creating an alert in TheHive, the workflow also adds **Observables**, also known as Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), supporting up to 7 IOCs.

*I'm not satisfied with this part yet, as it feels too limited and passive. The number of IOCs observed per alert is often insufficient, and I’m actively working on improving this aspect of the workflow.*

Once the IOCs are fully ingested into the alert, the workflow automatically **promotes the alert to a case**, allowing SOC Analysts to collaborate and investigate it more thoroughly.

Additionally, when a case is created, an integrated **LLM chain processes** the case data and generates a summarized analysis. This includes investigative guidance and hypotheses to help analysts respond more effectively. The summary is then posted as a comment within the case in TheHive.

Finally, a **notification message** is sent to the collaboration platform used by the SOC team (e.g., Gmail, Telegram, Slack, Microsoft Teams, etc.).

## Workflow in Details 

### Stage 1: Receive and handle ElastAlert data

<div align="center">
  <img src="/images/n8n/pic1.png" alt="pic1" />
</div>

The first stage of the workflow is receiving and handling alert data. Since we use ElastAlert2 - a flexible alerting framework for querying and generating alerts from Elastic Security, I chose a simple HTTP POST method for delivery.

If you're unfamiliar with how this works, please refer to the [phase4-elastic-security-alerting section](/deployment/elastic-siem/phase-4-elastic-security-alerting.md) where I walk through my ElastAlert2 configuration.

The Webhook node in n8n listens for incoming events from ElastAlert. When an alert is triggered, this node receives the complete alert data.

**Webhook node configuration:**
- **HTTP Methods**: POST
- **Authentication**: None
- **Respond**: Immediately
- **Options**:
   - **IP Whitelist**: 10.0.2.15 (my ElastAlert2 node)

The output event will look something like this (for the full alert, see [alert-example.json](/.build/n8n/alert-example.json)): 

```json
[
  {
    "headers": {
      "host": "10.0.3.13:5678",
      "user-agent": "python-requests/2.32.4",
      "accept-encoding": "gzip, deflate",
      "accept": "application/json;charset=utf-8",
      "connection": "keep-alive",
      "content-type": "application/json",
      "content-length": "21510"
    },
    "params": {},
    "query": {},
    "body": {
      "kibana.alert.rule.execution.timestamp": "2025-06-21T05:34:27.776Z",
      "kibana.alert.start": "2025-06-21T05:34:27.776Z",
      "kibana.alert.last_detected": "2025-06-21T05:34:27.776Z",
      "kibana.version": "8.18.2",
```

You could technically ingest this data directly into TheHive as an alert, but there are limitations:
- Elastic Security represents severity as a string (e.g., "low", "medium"), while TheHive expects numeric values (1, 2, 3, etc.).
- Some context and formatting may not align with TheHive’s schema.

That's why it’s better to apply a transformation layer. n8n supports both JavaScript and Python for scripting. I chose Python since I’m actively learning it alongside PowerShell, and it fits my current workflow.

Here’s what the transformation code looks like:

```python
# Severity mapping
severity_map = {
    'low': 1,
    'medium': 2,
    'high': 3,
    'critical': 4
}

# Get data from ElastAlert
body = _input.first().json.get("body", {})

# Severity
severity = body.get("kibana.alert.rule.severity", "")
severity_numeric = severity_map.get(severity.lower(), 0)

# TheHive Alert fields
summary = body.get("kibana.alert.reason", "No summary provided")
title = body.get("kibana.alert.rule.name", "No title provided")
host = body.get("host", {})
risk_score = body.get("kibana.alert.rule.risk_score", "none")

description = (
    f"### Alert Description\n"
    f"- **Source**: SOCIMP Elastic Security\n"
    f"- **Infected Host-Machine**: `{host.get('hostname','Unknown')}`\n"
    f"- **Infected Username**: `{host.get('name','Unknown')}`\n"
    f"- **Infected IP Address**: `{host.get('ip','Unknown')}`\n"
    f"- **Severity**: {severity}\n"
    f"- **Risk Score**: `{risk_score}`\n"
    f"- **Details**: {body.get('kibana.alert.rule.description', 'No summary')}\n"
    f"- **References**: {body.get('kibana.alert.rule.references', [])}\n"
)

# Build observables list
observables = []

def add_observable(obs_type, value):
    if value and value.lower() != "unknow":
        observables.append({ "json": { "type": obs_type, "value": value } })

# Add observables
add_observable("ip", body.get("source", {}).get("ip", "Unknow"))
add_observable("domain", body.get("url", {}).get("domain", "Unknow"))
add_observable("filename", body.get("process", {}).get("pe", {}).get("original_file_name", "Unknow"))
add_observable("other", body.get("process", {}).get("command_line", "Unknow"))

# Hashes → all as type "hash"
hashes = body.get("process", {}).get("hash", {})
for h in ["md5", "sha1", "sha256"]:
    hash_value = hashes.get(h, "Unknow")
    add_observable("hash", hash_value)

# Final output
return [
    {
        "json": {
            "severity_numeric": severity_numeric,
            "description": description,
            "title": title,
            "summary": summary,
            "observables": observables  
        }
    }
]
```
The key part of this script is converting the severity string into TheHive's expected numeric format, this avoids mapping errors between Elastic and TheHive. The rest of the code extracts alert fields to make the alert more readable and actionable for SOC analysts. After all, if alerts aren’t understandable, what’s the point of automating them?

Another useful part of the script is the IOC extraction. It converts observable data into structured key-value pairs like `filename:example.exe` or `hash:d3213mmasd...,` making it easy to loop over and dynamically inject them into TheHive’s "Add IOCs" node.

Here’s an example of the output:

```json
[
  {
    "severity_numeric": 2,
    "description": "### Alert Description\n- **Source**: SOCIMP Elastic Security\n- **Infected Host-Machine**: `SOCIMP-W-USER2`\n- **Infected Username**: `socimp-w-user2.socimp.local`\n- **Infected IP Address**: `192.168.168.4,127.0.0.1,::1`\n- **Severity**: medium\n- **Risk Score**: `47`\n- **Details**: Identifies a process termination event quickly followed by the deletion of its executable file.

    "title": "Process Termination followed by Deletion [Cloned For Test]",
    "summary": "process event with process PhamThanhSang-SOC-L1.exe, parent process explorer.exe, by Susan.Newman on socimp-w-user2.socimp.local created medium alert Process Termination followed by Deletion [Cloned For Test].",
    "observables": [
      {
        "json": {
          "type": "filename",
          "value": "CVDropper.exe"
        }
      },
      {
        "json": {
          "type": "other",
          "value": "\"C:\\Users\\susan.newman\\Downloads\\PhamThanhSang-SOC-L1.exe\" "
        }
      },
      {
        "json": {
          "type": "hash",
          "value": "283b620a0df4215cce81eeb9ffb3aa9d"
        }
      },
      {
        "json": {
          "type": "hash",
          "value": "0c302f5634fb0b3f88130dfedd705df83833c63d"
        }
      },
      {
        "json": {
          "type": "hash",
          "value": "0dc1ab33a1c9c7e54db7d3c74334ec1684fdcace7ea13ce3eca6e0f772e52e90"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

### Stage 2: Create TheHive Alert and dynamically add IOCs (Observables)

<div align="center">
  <img src="/images/n8n/pic2.png" alt="pic2" />
</div>

Once Stage 1 completes successfully, we move to Stage 2, where the alert data is passed into TheHive to create a new alert.

The first node in this stage is the TheHive `create : alert` node, available in n8n.

**TheHive `create : alert` Node configuration**: 
- **Name**: Create Alert #1
- **Credential to conenct with**: grab yor API key to n8n credentials
- **Resource**: Alert
- **Operation**: Create
- **Mapping Column Mode**: Map Each Column Manually
- **Fields**:
  - **Title**: {{ $json.title }} (it will grab data from previous Python node)
  - **Description**: {{ $json.description }}
  - **Type**: internal
  - **Source**: Elastic Security
  - **Source Reference**: {{ $('Receive ElastAlert Data').item.json.body['@timestamp'] }} (This one will grab @timestamp that occured the alert to give SOC Analysts the timestamp that they need to look at in Elastic SIEM)
  - **Severity**: {{ $json.severity_numeric }} (it will grab transformed severity from previous Python node, if the incident severity is "medium", the value of this field will be `2`, and in TheHive's alerts, it will automatically be MEDIUM)
  - **Date**: {{ $('Receive ElastAlert Data').item.json.body['kibana.alert.last_detected'] }}
  - **Tags**: {{ $('Receive ElastAlert Data').item.json.body['kibana.alert.rule.tags'] }} (The reason i prefer n8n than Shuffle since it detect array and handle it by default instead of more few line code to extracts tags from Elastic Alert and split them one by one)
  - **TLP**: Amber
  - **PAP**: Amber
  - **Summary**: {{ $json.summary }}
  - **Status**: New

**Example Output:**

```json

    "_id": "~205090856",

  }
]
```

Once the alert is created, the next essential step is to add IOCs (Indicators of Compromise) to it. This makes investigations much easier for analysts, as they immediately gain observable evidence tied to the alert.

TheHive node `create : observable` is used for this step.

**`create : obserable` Node Configuration:**
- **Name**: Add IOC#[number]
- **Credential to conenct with**: Same as in the alert creation step
- **Resouce**: Observable
- **Operation**: Create
- **Creat in**: Alert
- **Alert**:
  - **By ID**: {{ $json._id }} (Links the observable to the correct alert rather than adding it globally)
- **Data Type**: {{ $('Alert Transformation #1').item.json.observables[0].json.type }} 
- **Data**: {{ $('Alert Transformation #1').item.json.observables[0].json.value }}

*This is where the Python transformation really proves its value. By structuring observables correctly and omitting nulls, the workflow remains efficient and clean.*

**Example Ouput**:
```json
[
  {
    "_id": "~82215000",
    "_type": "Observable",
    "_createdBy": "example@gmail.com",
    "_createdAt": 1750843852595,
    "dataType": "filename",
    "data": "CVDropper.exe",
    "startDate": 1750843852595,
    "tlp": 2,
    "tlpLabel": "AMBER",
    "pap": 2,
    "papLabel": "AMBER",
    "tags": [],
    "ioc": false,
    "sighted": false,
    "reports": {},
    "extraData": {},
    "ignoreSimilarity": false
  }
]
```
And now i could repeat this node for additional observables by referencing array positions: [0], [1], [2], etc.

*Note: Be sure to set the node's **On Error** setting to Continue. This ensures the workflow doesn't break if fewer than 7 IOCs are present. Instead, it will gracefully continue with the available data.*

I’ll discuss this design choice and its trade-offs in the **Future Improvement** section.

### Stage 3: Create TheHive Case and enrich context by AI

<div align="center">
  <img src="/images/n8n/pic3.png" alt="pic3" />
</div>

Once the alert and its associated IOCs are ready, it's time to promote the alert to a case, just like opening a ticket. This allows SOC analysts to investigate collaboratively, track progress, and close the case effectively.

To do this, the workflow uses TheHive’s `promote : case` node. This node is straightforward: it takes the alert ID and promotes it into a case.

**TheHive `promote : case` Node Configuration:**
- **Credential to connect with**: Like previous nodes
- **Resource**: Alert
- **Operation**: Promote to Case
- **Alert**:
  - **By ID**: {{ $('Create Alert #1').item.json._id }} (This will grab alert id to use)

The output will look like below:
```json
[
  {
    "_id": "~205107240",
    "_type": "Case",
    "_createdBy": "sang3112002@gmail.com",

    "title": "Process Termination followed by Deletion [Cloned For Test]",

    "alertImportedDate": 1750844569333,
    "timeToDetect": 0
  }
]
```

At this point, the workflow could be considered complete, an alert has been promoted to a case. However, there’s an opportunity to enhance it further using AI.

By integrating AI, we can generate useful context for analysts at the moment the case is created. A language model can summarize the alert, extract key IOCs, infer possible tactics and techniques, and even suggest investigative directions. This creates a much stronger starting point for any analyst picking up the case.

n8n makes this easy with the **Basic LLM Chain** node.

**Basic LLM Chain Configuration**:
- **Source for Prompt (User Message)**: Define below
- **Prompt (User Message)**: {{ $('Receive ElastAlert Data').item.json.body }} (This take alert data as entry point and use it to analyze the case)
- **Chat Messages (If Using a Chat Model)**
  - **Type Name or ID**: User
  - **Message Type**: Text
  - **Message**: 
```text
    You are an AI SOC Assistance, base on Alert context. 
You tone should be clarity and precise.
Generate a technical plain-text summary (max 10–15 lines) of this Elastic Security Alert.
Use \n for line breaks only; no markdown. No "Here is a summary of the security alert in plain", use "Context Enrichment - Powered By SOCIMP AI Workflow" instead

Structure the summary as follows:
- Brief summary of the alert and its context
- Likely Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) based on observed behavior
- Extracted Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) directly from the alert (e.g. IPs, domains, hashes, filenames, commands). New line each IOCs (use "\n")

Threat Intelligence enrichment, including any related malware, campaigns, or threat actors
Analyst recommendations, such as log sources to review, systems to investigate, or threat hunting guidance
Short hypothesis on the attack's goal, stage, or threat actor intent based on available evidence
```

I use Groq as the backend model provider since it offers free access under certain rate limits. You can choose any provider - better models typically yield better analysis.

**Example Output**:

```json
[
  {
    "text": "Context Enrichment - Powered By SOCIMP AI Workflow\n\nThis alert is triggered by a process termination event quickly followed by the deletion of its executable file, which is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.

  }
]
```

This AI-generated summary gives SOC analysts a bird’s-eye view of the case, enabling faster triage and focused investigation.

The last node in this stage is a TheHive `add : comment` node. It takes the generated AI output and appends it as a comment to the promoted case.

**`add : comment` Node Configuration**:
- **Credential to connect with**: Same as previous TheHive nodes (or optionally a dedicated service account for the AI bot like i did)
- **Resource**: Comment
- **Operation**: Create
- **Add to**: Case
- **Case**:
  - **By ID**: {{ $('Promote to Case#1').item.json._id }}
- **Message**: {{ $json.text }}

**Output will look like below**:

### Stage 4: Send notification to Slack SOCIMP's channel

<div align="center">
  <img src="/images/n8n/pic4.png" alt="pic4" />

Finally, once the case is created and the AI-generated summary is complete, it’s time to notify SOC team via collaboration tools. n8n supports many integrations including email, Slack, Telegram, Microsoft Teams, and more. For my project, I used **Slack**.

Before sending messages to Slack, you need to create a Slack App and assign it the appropriate permissions(e.g., `chat:write`, `channels:read`), For setup guidance, refer to [Introduction to Slack apps](https://api.slack.com/start/building)

**Slack `post : message` Node Configuration**:
- **Credential to connect with**: Slack client ID - secret and Token
- **Resource**: Message
- **Operation**: Send
- **Send Message To**: Channel
- **Channel**:
  - **By Name**: secops-notification (This is the channel i used for notification)
- **Message Type**: Simple Text Message
- **Message Text**:
```text
*New Case Created in TheHive*

*Title:* {{ $('Promote to Case#1').item.json.title }}
*Severity:* {{ $('Promote to Case#1').item.json.severityLabel }}
*Created At:* {{ $('Create Alert #1').item.json.sourceRef }}
*Status:* {{ $json["status"] || "Open" }}

Case URL: http://10.0.3.11:9000/cases/{{ $('Promote to Case#1').item.json._id }}/details
```

Output will look like below:
```json

## Workflow in Action

![pic12](/images/n8n/pic12.png)

When a new case is created, a Slack message is sent containing key case details, such as the title, severity, creation time, status, and a direct link to the case in TheHive:

![pic5](/images/n8n/pic5.png)

Clicking the case URL will open the case directly in TheHive:

![pic6](/images/n8n/pic6.png)

- **Left panel:** Case metadata (severity, TLP, PAP, start date, contributors, case ID, etc.)
- **Middle panel:** Alert details (title, tags, data source context)
- **Right panel:** Comments, including AI-generated case summaries and analyst discussions

From the SOC Analyst’s perspective, this workflow delivers valuable, structured information that significantly streamlines the investigation process, especially with the addition of LLM-driven enrichment.

## Future Improvement
While the current workflow is fully functional and helpful, there are several areas where further improvement is planned:
- **IOC Handling**: The IOC injection process needs to be more dynamic and scalable. I plan to enhance it to support flexible observable types and edge-case handling.
- **Threat Intelligence Integration**: Currently, observables are added to the case, but their analysis is still limited. Once the IOC structure is more robust, I intend to integrate Threat Intelligence Platforms (e.g., MISP, OpenCTI) and OSINT sources to automatically enrich the case with contextual intelligence.
- **AI Integration**: While the LLM chain adds substantial value, using public AI models to process internal security alerts introduces privacy and compliance risks. For production use, enterprise environments should adopt self-hosted or private LLM solutions.
- **Scalability and Performance**: As alert volume increases and more SOC team members engage simultaneously, the workflow must remain responsive and efficient. Optimization will focus on execution time, error handling, and concurrency control.

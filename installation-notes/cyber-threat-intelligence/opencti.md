OpenCTI Installation Notes

</h1>

OpenCTI is a resource-intensive platform due to the many components required for its operation, including Elasticsearch, Redis, MinIO, RabbitMQ, OpenCTI-core, and others. The more connectors you use to feed threat data into OpenCTI, the more resource-demanding the platform becomes.

To address these requirements, Iâ€™ve set up OpenCTI on a **two-node Debian cluster** using Docker, with Docker Swarm for orchestration. The nodes are managed through **Portainer**, which simplifies monitoring and scaling. If I encounter storage limitations or exceed the hardware resources like RAM or CPU, or if I need additional redundancy, I can easily add more nodes to the cluster and join them to the Docker Swarm.

### Prerequisites
1. **Docker**, you can find install instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/) for Debian
2. **Docker Swarm**, to get more details how to create and join a swarm, go to [Docker's documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/swarm-tutorial/create-swarm/) for Swarm Mode
3. **Docker Portainer**, a very lightweight node and easy to install/manage, you can find it out [here](https://docs.portainer.io/start/install-ce/server/docker/linux)


### Setup Note
At the time i was deploying OpenCTI Stack, i encounterd a issue due to 'healthy check' and could'nt start the stack, seems like its new version of OpenCTI's docker-compose.yml  

1. 
```bash
```

2. 
```bash
```

3.

OPNSense Firewall Installation Notes

</h1>
Frontline of my SOCIMP project is OPNSense -  an open source, easy-to-use and easy-to-build FreeBSD based firewall and routing platform. 
<br>
<br>
I chose to use OPNSense over pfSense since it has nicer interface (in my opinion), Suricata built-in which is important for Network Security and also integrate with other components in the project. Also, i never work with OPNSense before, so it's good time to learn new things. 

### Setup
Install OPNSense on Proxmox in a VM is easy as drinking a glass of water.
